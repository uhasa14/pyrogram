        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/bots.rst

        Parameters:
            title (``str``):
                Product name, 1-32 characters.

            description (``str``):
                Product description, 1-255 characters

            payload (``str`` | ``bytes``):
                Bot-defined invoice payload, 1-128 bytes. This will not be displayed to the user, use for your internal processes.

            currency (``str``):
                Three-letter ISO 4217 currency code, see `more on currencies <https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments#supported-currencies>`_. Pass ``XTR`` for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

            prices (List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.LabeledPrice`):
                Price breakdown, a JSON-serialized list of components (e.g. product price, tax, discount, delivery cost, delivery tax, bonus, etc.). Must contain exactly one item for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

            reply_to_message_id (``int``, *optional*):
                If the message is a reply, ID of the original message.

            provider_token (``str``, *optional*):
                Payment provider token, obtained via `@BotFather <https://t.me/botfather>`_. Pass an empty string for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

            max_tip_amount (``int``, *optional*):
                The maximum accepted amount for tips in the smallest units of the currency (integer, **not** float/double). For example, for a maximum tip of ``US$ 1.45`` pass ``max_tip_amount = 145``. See the exp parameter in `currencies.json <https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments/currencies.json>`_, it shows the number of digits past the decimal point for each currency (2 for the majority of currencies). Defaults to 0. Not supported for payments in `Telegram Stars <https://t.me/BotNews/90>`_.

            suggested_tip_amounts (List of ``int``, *optional*):
                An array of suggested amounts of tips in the smallest units of the currency (integer, **not** float/double). At most 4 suggested tip amounts can be specified. The suggested tip amounts must be positive, passed in a strictly increased order and must not exceed ``max_tip_amount``.

            start_parameter (``str``, *optional*):
                Unique deep-linking parameter. If left empty, **forwarded copies** of the sent message will have a Pay button, allowing multiple users to pay directly from the forwarded message, using the same invoice. If non-empty, forwarded copies of the sent message will have a URL button with a deep link to the bot (instead of a Pay button), with the value used as the start parameter.

            provider_data (``str``, *optional*):
                JSON-serialized data about the invoice, which will be shared with the payment provider. A detailed description of required fields should be provided by the payment provider.

            photo_url (``str``, *optional*):
                URL of the product photo for the invoice. Can be a photo of the goods or a marketing image for a service. People like it better when they see what they are paying for.

            photo_size (``int``, *optional*):
                Photo size in bytes

            photo_width (``int``, *optional*):
